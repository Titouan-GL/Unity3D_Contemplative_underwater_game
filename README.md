# Underwater Contemplative Game
this project was made for the entrance test of enjmin. I made this game in 23 days and this was pretty intense since I was still learning Unity. The project itself is too big to be put on GitHub so I only put the compressed executable and my scripts, but it's pretty unclean. This was still extremely interesting because I learned many things like compute shaders and procedural animation.
In order to use it just extract the zip file and launch the .exe
